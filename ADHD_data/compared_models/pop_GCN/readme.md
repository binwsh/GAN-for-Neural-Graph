Graph CNNs for population graphs: classification of the ABIDE dataset
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 This code provides a python - Tensorflow implementation of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for semi-supervised
 disease prediction using population graphs, as described in:

We provide an implementation applied to the [ABIDE dataset](preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide)
for diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
We also provide the list of scans from the [ADNI dataset](adni.loni.usc.edu/) used in our experiments. Each element of the list is in the format {SUBJECT_ID}_{ACQUISITION_MONTH}

#### INSTALLATION

To run the programme, you will need to install the implementation of graph convolutional networks (GCN) by Kipf et al.
This project is only compatible with our [forked GCN project](https://github.com/parisots/gcn).  
```
conda create --name pop
conda activate pop
conda install python=3.7
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd gcn
python setup.py install
cd ..
```

The root folder in fetch_data.py (line 12) and ABIDEParser.py (line 17) has to be updated to the folder were the data will be stored.

Next, to install, organise and pre-process the ABIDE database:
```python
python fetch_data.py
```


#### USAGE

To run the programme with default parameters:
 ```python
python my_main_ABIDE.py
```

To get a detailed description of parameters:
 ```python
python my_main_ABIDE.py --help
 ```


#### REQUIREMENTS

tensorflow (>0.12) <br />
networkx <br />
nilearn <br />
scikit-learn <br />
joblib
